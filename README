Expands selections to the closest containing pairs of single or double quotes or backticks.


Original Read_ME
The default keybinding is Ctrl+'.

With cursor at X, the command should select the string:
"Here is the X cursor"

With cursor at X, the command should select the single quoted string:
"Here is 'the X cursor' now"

With cursor at X, the command should select the double quoted string:
"Here the cursor is 'outside' the X selection"

Forked Ammendments
Now the code logic is such that you can use the selection keybinding to select either Delimited String or a Bare String by toggling the key binding

Don't like that between quotes only is the initialized mode--change it in the settings file included

>>Just a reminder to put your OWN preferences in the .../Packages/user/ directory BUT don't move the selection-mode.sublime-settings from the /Installed Packages/ directory
